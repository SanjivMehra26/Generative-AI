# Generative-AI
What you'll learn
How to code generative A.I architectures from scratch using Python and Pytorch
How generative architectures work, in great depth, from GANs to multimodal A.I, understanding every little detail in the process
In addition to the coding, every section begins with an in-depth review of the key concepts related to these architectures
Examples: We will code a generative network that produces human faces, and also combine two advanced networks to transform text prompts into amazing images.
Examples: We will learn to edit the clothes of a person in a picture by combining a segmentation architecture with the Stable Diffusion generative model
Special Bonus Section: Journey to the latent space of a neural network, learn in depth how the networks that power Generative AI learn their mappings
Special Bonus Section: Experience a guided visualization to exercise the generative model in your head while you learn many things about neural networks
